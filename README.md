# CTChromecast
`CTChromecast` is a collection of classes to make integrating Chromecast support into an existing iOS video player easier. 

`CTChromecastMoviePlayerController` provides a drop in replacement for `MPMoviePlayerController` to support casting videos to Chromecast

## Usage

Creation of a movie player can be done in the same way a MPMoviePlayerController is used

```objective-c
CTChromecastMoviePlayerController *player = [[CTChromecastMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithContentURL: url];
player.view.frame = self.view.bounds;
[self.view addSubview: player.view];    
[player play];
````

When chromecast device(s) are detected a button allowing for device selection will be shown along side the volume sider
